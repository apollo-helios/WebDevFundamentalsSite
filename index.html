                <p id="motte-and-bailey">The Castle of Kilkenny is located in the town of Kilkenny which is known in
                    Irish as <i>Chill Chainnigh</i>. The castle was first constructed as a wooden motte and bailey
                    castle by Robert de Clare, otherwise known as Strongbow. </p>

                <p id="stone-castle">It was constructed on a hill that overlooked several important trade routes and a
                    ford across the River Nore, later it was rebuilt with stone.</p>

                <p id="description"> When the castle was originally built it was a classic square castle with 4 round
                    drum towers connected with curtain walls. Nowadays the castle only has three walls and three towers,
                    because during the Cromwellian War in Ireland it was besieged by Parliamentarian forces, and the
                    Eastern wall and North-Eastern tower were severely damaged.
