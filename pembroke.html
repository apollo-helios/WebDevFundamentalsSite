    <h2>The Earls of Pembroke</h2>
    <p>After the Norman conquest of Ireland, the Earls of Pembroke took control of the land around Kilkenny. They were
        relatives of Robert de Clare, better known as Strongbow. They constructed the original wooden motte and bailey
        castle in 1173, which burned down at some point before 1195. In 1195 Robert de Clare's son-in-law William
        Marshall started construction on a new stone castle with 4 round drum towers connected by curtain walls which
        completed in 1213. This castle is the basis for the current structure. The Earls of Pembroke maintained
        ownership of the castle and the surrounding lands until 1391 at which point the Butler family, the Earls of
        Ormonde, bought it from them.</p>
