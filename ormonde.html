            <h2>The Earls of Ormonde</h2>
            <p>
                The Earldom of Ormonde was first created for James Butler in 1328 as a reward for his loyalty to the
                Crown of King Edward III. James Butler and his successors had their seat at Gowran Castle until James
                Butler, the 3rd Earl of Ormonde, purchased Kilkenny Castle from the Marshall Family. The Butler family
                kept their Usual residence at the Gowran Castle until Piers Butler, the 8th Earl of Ormonde, moved his
                family into Kilkenny Castle. The Butler family kept their Usual residence at Kilkenny Castle from 1498
                to 1935.

                The Butler Dynasty was a powerful family in the history of Ireland, they held multiple Chief
                Governorships of Ireland, and were generally the largest land owners in Ireland outside of the Crown
                lands. They were eventually raised from Earls of Ormonde to Dukes of Ormonde for service to the Crown
                during the English Civil War and the Cromwellian Invasion of Ireland. They lost the Duchy when the 3rd
                Duke of Ormonde died, and after the 2nd Duke of Ormonde was accused of supporting the Jacobite Revolt of
                1715 and was stripped of his titles. They later received a marquessate when James Butler, the 17th Earl
                of Ormonde, became a companion of George IV during the Regency period, and was rewarded for his loyalty
                by being created the 1st Marquess of Ormonde.

                Throughout the centuries under the Butler family, Kilkenny Castle was the center of some significant
                moments in Irish History. During the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, the Association of The Confederate
                Catholics of Ireland was created to lead the Catholic war effort, and the Supreme Council of the Irish
                Confederacy met in Kilkenny Castle from 1642-1648. When Cromwell invaded in 1649 he made it a priority
                to break the resistance of the Irish, so he attacked the symbolic seat of the Irish Confederacy,
                Kilkenny Castle, in 1650. This siege is the reason why the existing castle only has 3 walls and 3
                towers, the eastern wall and north-eastern tower were severely damaged in the siege and were later torn
                down. When the Butlers returned from exile in 1661, they remodelled the castle as a "modern" French
                chateau. Another important event in the castle's history came a few centuries later. When the Irish
                civil war broke out in 1922, Republican forces seized the castle, soon after the opposing Irish Free
                State besieged the caste. The siege lasted 2 days and ended when the Irish Free State forces crashed a
                car into the castle.
