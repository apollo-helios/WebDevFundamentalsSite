                <p>Today Kilkenny Castle is a major tourist attraction in the City of Kilkenny. It was sold to the
                    people of Kilkenny for a nominal sum of &pound;50 by Arthur Butler, 6th Marquess of Ormonde, and
                    managed by the Irish Office of Public Works since 1969.</p>

                <p>The Parade Tower is a conference venue available for events and weddings, and has been used for
